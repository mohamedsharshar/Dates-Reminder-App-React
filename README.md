To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v12 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Clone the Repository

```

### Install Dependencies

Once inside the project directory, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash

```

## Running the App

To run the application in development mode:

```

This will start the app and open it in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The app will automatically reload if you make any edits.

## Building the App

To build the app for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` folder with the production-ready files. These files are optimized and minified, ready for deployment.

### Serve the Production Build

To serve the production build locally:

1. Install the `serve` package globally if you don't have it:

   ```bash
   npm install -g serve
   ```

2. Run `serve` on the `build` folder:

   ```bash
   serve -s build
   ```

This will start a local server at `http://localhost:5000`.
